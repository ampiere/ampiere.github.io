		<h2>Work with BE 1250</h2>
		<img id="mainpic" src="http://i.imgur.com/RrIJdLM.jpg" />
		<p>The introductory course for incoming fall students outlines the general idea of engineering and specifically bioengineering. Furthermore, students have the opportunity to learn the basics of common computer programs like Excel, AutoCAD, and Inventor. The term project allowed the students to 3D print prototypes of gears to be paired with windmill activity kits.</p>
		<p>As a two-time teacher’s assistant (TA) to the course, I have helped troubleshoot students’ problems with the aforementioned computer programs. Due to the success of the work, and from the help of the faculty, I was hired to be the first time supplemental instructor of not only BE 1250, but throughout the history of the department. This position has been one of the most enjoyable experiences here at LSU, and you can find out more about it by clicking <a style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-nU7scc1klYRmdDNGRJYjg2S0E">here</a>.
		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>Current research under the electrical engineering professor <a href="http://www.ece.lsu.edu/choi/" style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline">Dr. Jin-Woo Choi</a> entails designing and optimizing an orthopedic glove to enable patients with impaired motor control. The idea is to use electromyography sensors to pick up neck and shoulder muscle activity and actuate the hand and fingers to perform several common poses. The design will ideally be low cost and easily customized for patients’ needs.</p>
