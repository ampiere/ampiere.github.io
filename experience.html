		<h2>Work with BE 1251</h2>
		<p>The introductory course for incoming fall students outlines the general idea of engineering and specifically bioengineering. Furthermore, students have the opportunity to learn the basics of common computer programs like Excel, AutoCAD, and Inventor. The term project allowed the students to 3D print prototypes of gears to be paired with windmill activity kits.</p>
		<p>As a two-time teacher’s assistant (TA) to the course, I have helped troubleshoot students’ problems with the aforementioned computer programs. Due to the success of the work, and from the help of the faculty, I was hired to be the first time supplemental instructor of not only BE 1251, but throughout the history of the department. This position has been one of the most enjoyable experiences here at LSU.</p>
