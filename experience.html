		<h2>Supplemental Instructor</h2>
		<p>The biological engineering introduction course BE 1251 is among one of the first courses in the BE curriculum. Titled Introduction to Engineering Methods, students learn about Microsoft Office, AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, and research papers, Most importantly, the course teaches students about the applications of the major itself. It also being a communication-intensive (CI) course, student also learn about proper communication skills and team-building exercises with the final team project. BE 1251 is a 2-credit course, with 1 hour lecture and 3 hours lab.</p>
		<p>As the first-time SI Leader for  this course, my ultimate goal was to help students better understand both the course material and the major itself. Among the duties of an SI Leader is to host weekly review sessions that encompassed material from the lecture and lab. I created a database of worksheets, exercises, and examples that students could work on during these sessions. Additionally, I held office hours so that any student available could direct his or her questions to me.</p>
		<h2>Teacher's Assistant</h2>
		<p>The Biological Engineering course BE 1250 is one of the first engineering courses in the BE curriculum. Titled Introduction to Engineering Methods, the 2-hour course introduces common computer programs such as Microsoft Excel, Autodesk Inventor, and Autodesk AutoCAD. I had the privilege of being an assistant to the instructor of the class, helping grade papers, set up projects, troubleshoot problems, and answer questions to the best of my ability. Ultimately I took great pleasure helping guide newcomers of the major and, after two semesters of holding the position, have found it to be one of the most enjoyable experiences in my undergraduate years.</p>
