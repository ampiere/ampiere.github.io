		<h2>London and Edinburgh</h2>
		<p>During the summer of 2015 I, along with a handful of my good friends, took flight across the Atlantic Ocean to study abroad in London and Edinburgh. While there, I balanced my time between studies in the two classes I was enrolled in and exploration of the culture surrounding me. One of the two classes was a Music Appreciation course, which outlined the social impact of music throughout the centuries. We learned of many famous composers, musicians, and bands that had their inception right where we stood. The other course, titled Science in the Theatre, explored the scientific credibility in modern movies and plays. We listened to published authors talk about their takes on the role of science in the theatre, read and watched several plays, and learned the history about crucial scientific findings.</p>

		<p>Aside from coursework, my friends and I learned of the thriving culture that inhabits London, Liverpool, Grasmere, and Edinburgh. From endless museums to monumental cathedrals, and from rolling hills to bustling cities, finally viewing the world at a different standpoint definitely opened my eyes. This trip has been one of the most inspirational events in my life.</p>
