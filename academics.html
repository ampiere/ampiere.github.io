		<h2>Sciences</h2>
		<p>One of the focuses of the Biological Engineering major is, of course, biology. These courses include a year of general biology and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-nU7scc1klYbjVOSUt0elNick0" style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline">biology labs</a>, which lead into microbiology. Microbiology (BIOL 2051) included lecture and laboratory discussion about basic phylogeny, pathology, immunology, and other fundamental molecular processes. Biochemistry (BIOL 2083) elaborates on those molecular processes, blending in concepts from chemistry courses in the curriculum. Other natural sciences include physics classes and a lab, covering particle kinematics, fields, and circuit theory.</p>

		<h2>Bioengineering</h2>
		<p>The bioengineering courses aim to be stepping stones throughout the curriculum, with each step recapitulating concepts from the aforementioned science courses. Freshman courses (BE 1250 and BE 1252) introduced the concept of bioengineering and allowed students to utilize 3D-modeling programs to visualize and print prototypes. Projects were as large as creating <a style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-nU7scc1klYc3JnNGstZEJyUUU">childrenâ€™s playgrounds</a>, some of which have been actually built! Sophomore courses (BE 2350 and BE 2352) outline the entire basics of experimentation and instrumentation. These topics include sensor implementation, data acquisition, statistical and error analysis, and engineering economics.</p>
		<p>Junior and senior courses at LSU are more specialized in their topics. For example, BE 4332 covers the basics of molecular techniques in bioengineering, introducing spectrophotometry, chromatography, microscopy, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-nU7scc1klYdXZJZzAwM1ZYNHc" style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline">assays</a>, and sequencing. BE 4336 explores biomaterial and how their properties affect their biocompatibility. Lectures covered topics like <a style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-nU7scc1klYNGNTendZWGFHZUE">experimental design</a>, synthesizing and treating biomaterials, cell signaling, and carcinogenesis.</p>

		<h2>Robotics Engineering</h2>
		<p>Courses in the Robotics Engineering minor elaborate on the mathematics and programming of robotic control. ENGR 3100 covers a plethora of introductory concepts such as sensor programming, manipulator kinematics, control architecture, vision systems, and wireless communications. The term project for the course entailed <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-nU7scc1klYR0VDZmRUMkpXcEU" style="color: #0000EE; text-decoration: underline">designing an autonomous robot</a> to routinely inspect for pests and diseases in sugar cane crops. BE 4103 is a future course that will discuss the history and development of assistive robotics. Other courses in the minor include linear algebra, differential equations, and computer programming.</p>
		
		<h2>Other Engineering</h2>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 100px">The bioengineering curriculum includes several other specializations of engineering, such as civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. Topics covered include mechanics of materials, thermodynamic properties, and fundamentals of circuit theory and design.</p>
