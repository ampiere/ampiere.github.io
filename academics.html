		<p>Currently I am enrolled at LSU with a major in Biological Engineering and a minor in Robotics Engineering. I am planning to graduate in the spring with the class of 2018. The biological engineering courses cover pertinent topics across mathematics, biology, chemistry, as well as key elements in the engineering process. Engineering courses cover ideas such as proper experiment design, iterative prototyping, computing and analyzing data, and presentation skills.</p>
		<p>Originally I entered LSU in the Honors College, denoting that I had achieved high marks in both school and standardized tests. I have since taken several honors classes ranging from science and math classes to special seminar classes, including topics such as ancient astronomy and scientific theatrical plays.</p>
		<p>The robotics minor elaborates on the industrial and autonomous engineering skill set, focusing on computer programming, actuation, sensor systems, and more. This minor essentially provides a more digital concentration to the biological aspect of my major.</p>
