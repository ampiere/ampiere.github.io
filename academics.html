		<h2>Sciences</h2>
		<p>One of the focuses of the Biological Engineering major is, of course, biology. These courses include a year of general biology and biology labs, which lead into microbiology. Microbiology (BIOL 2051) included lecture and laboratory discussion about basic phylogeny, pathology, immunology, and other fundamental molecular processes. Biochemistry (BIOL 2083) elaborates on those molecular processes, blending in concepts from chemistry courses in the curriculum. Other natural sciences include physics classes and a lab, covering particle kinematics, fields, and circuit theory.</p>

		<h2>Bioengineering</h2>
		<p>The bioengineering courses aim to be stepping stones throughout the curriculum, with each step recapitulating concepts from the aforementioned science courses. Freshman courses (BE 1250 and BE 1252) introduced the concept of bioengineering and allowed students to utilize 3D-modeling programs to visualize and print prototypes. Projects were as large as creating childrenâ€™s playgrounds, some of which have been actually built! Sophomore courses (BE 2350 and BE 2352) outline the entire basics of experimentation and instrumentation. These topics include sensor implementation, data acquisition, statistical and error analysis, and engineering economics.</p>
		<p>Junior and senior courses at LSU are more specialized in their topics. For example, BE 4332 covers the basics of molecular techniques in bioengineering, introducing spectrophotometry, chromatography, microscopy, assays, and sequencing. The newly created course BE 4336 explores biomaterial and how their properties affect their biocompatibility. Lectures covered topics like imaging immune responses, synthesizing and treating biomaterials, cell signaling, and carcinogenesis.</p>
		<p>Each BE course includes at least one student presentation per semester, which comes with the Communication Intensive (CI) accreditation. Through the program, students have the opportunity to lecture and present their engineered solutions to their peers.</p>

		<h2>Robotics Engineering</h2>
		<p>Originally I entered LSU in the Honors College, denoting that I had achieved high marks in both school and standardized tests. I have since taken several honors classes ranging from science and math classes to special seminar classes, including topics such as ancient astronomy and scientific theatrical plays.</p>
		
		<h2>Other Engineering</h2>
		<p>The robotics minor elaborates on the industrial and autonomous engineering skill set, focusing on computer programming, actuation, sensor systems, and more. This minor essentially provides a more digital concentration to the biological aspect of my major.</p>
		<p>The engineering curriculum contains a numerous amount of communication-intensive (CI) courses that express important aspects of becoming an engineer. Courses include opportunities such as designing and presenting school playgrounds, digitally constructing and 3D printing windmill gears, interviewing graduate students, and writing research papers and lab reports. The goal of these courses are to help students understand how to efficiently solve problems, showcase the work entailed, develop interpersonal skills, and ultimately how to become an engineer.</p>
		<p>Later courses in the curriculums include Biomechanics, Molecular Methods, and Neuromotor Control of Human Movement. The goal for the end of my undergraduate years is to have a solid foundation to continue to learn about biomechanics and prosthetics. Currently my long-term aspiration is to continue research in the field of prosthetics with a PhD.</p>
