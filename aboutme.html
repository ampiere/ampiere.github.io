    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <img id="mainpic" src="http://i.imgur.com/CaZA3Mx.jpg" />
    <p>Born and raised in Covington, Louisiana, I spent much of my academic years exploring my interests in mathematics and biology. Throughout high school, I was fascinated with the world of robotics, prosthetics, and automation, which brought me to college-level courses like AP Statistics, AP Biology, and Digital Electronics. Feeling confident with my interests, I went to pursue a Biological Engineering degree at Louisiana State University. Here at LSU I am not only continuing to explore the applications of those interests, I have also been enjoying broadening my scope by encountering brand new topics and studies.</p>

    <p>On a personal note, I enjoy all things music, such as attending concerts and playing instruments like bass guitar and drums. I was even in a high school rock band! I have studied abroad in London and Edinburgh in the summer of 2015, which was an amazing and eye-opening experience. Currently I am teaching myself languages like German in hopes to continue studying in other countries. I enjoy starting small projects during school breaks, most of which utilize Raspberry Pi and other electronics. Other hobbies of mine include bowling, video games, graphic design, and especially cooking.</p>
    <p>Future aspirations include continuing my studies in biological engineering and its vast human applications. The intriguing capabilities of modern technologies have inspired me to extend my education past undergraduate school to obtain a PhD. From there I would like to research topics involving molecular biology, biomaterial mechanics, and prosthetics. </p>
