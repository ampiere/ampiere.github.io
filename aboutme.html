    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img style="float: right"id=mainpic src="http://i.imgur.com/mTHHWZx.png" />
    <p style="float: left">Born and raised in Covington, Louisiana, I set off to bustling Baton Rouge to attend Louisiana State University in August 2014. There, I have made great relationships with new friends and shared great moments with old friends, all while pursuing my major in biological engineering. I entered LSU as an Honors student and have taken several honors courses, but I have since been handling many other tasks such as pursuing a robotics minor, founding the ASABE LSU robotics team, being an active member of BESO, and more. I have a special interest in studying prosthetics later on, and currently I am aiming to continue my education for a PhD.</p>
    
    <p>On a more personal note, I enjoy playing bass guitar and drums as a hobby. In fact, at one point I performed in a band with some of my friends. I also like tinkering with electronics and hooking up my Raspberry Pi with other electronics. Nothing says "retro fanboy" more than a homemade all-in-one Nintendo emulator controller. I am also fond of attending concerts and movies, and I especially enjoy cooking.</p>
