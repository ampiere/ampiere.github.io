		<h2>BESO</h2>
		<p>The Biological Engineering Student Organization (BESO), as its name suggests, is an organization made by students, for students. The main goals of BESO are to create an inclusive community within the BE curriculum as well as to help show students the full potential of their major outside of undergraduate years. BESO features guest speakers ranging from students to professors to employers, ensuring that all interests amongst students are addressed and engaged.</p>
		<p>One of BESO's highlights is its annual Sweet Potato and Rice Sale. By selling the homegrown products of LSU alumni of the BE major, the organization gets its funding for educational and recreational activities. I will be holding the position of Fundraising Officer of BESO starting my third year, and will be overlooking the sale.</p>
		<h2>Tau Beta Pi</h2>
		<p>Tau Beta Pi is an honors engineering society that recognizes outstanding academic achievements in juniors and seniors. The society qualifies the top one-fifth of juniors and the top one-eighth of seniors, emphasizing its highly selective criteria. Since my induction into Tau Beta Pi during my second year, I have been part of its social events and philanthropic opportunities.</p>
